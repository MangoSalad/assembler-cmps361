# Assembler and Emulator for VC-3600 Computer
This is an assembler and emulator that is designed to run a vc3600 computer. This was a school project for cmps361 at Ramapo College of NJ.

## VC-3600 Assembly Language

### Assembly Language Instructions
 - DC - define constant. The constant is a decimal integer placed in the operand field.
 - DS - define storage. The operand specifies the number of words of storage to be set aside.
 - ORG -define origin. The operand specifies the address at which the translation of the next instruction will be generated,
 - END â€“ indicates that there are no additional statements to translate.
